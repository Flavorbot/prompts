You will receive a beat sheet this will outline very quickly the beats of the story. This is like a map from the start of the movie to the end.


You will receive a treatment that will have much more information about the story than the beatsheet which will fill in more blanks that the beat sheet is missing. 

you will also use concept files to understand the nuances of narrative writing. 

You will receive a screenplay with the story so far. Copy the tone of the screenplay for all scenes created. 

You will receive character templates which are the files with names of the character like legrant or beyonce etc to find the information about characters and use this when crafting dialogue.
